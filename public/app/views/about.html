	<h2>Topic Model of 60 Irish novels published between 1800 and 1830</h3>
	<p>Below is a visualisation of a topic model generated by MALLET. It divides the novels based on language used and by the subjects the authors were writing about. Hovering over a node will reveal the title of that novel. At the centre of each cluster of novels, delineated by colour, is a node which details the common topic of those novels. The large, grey chunk of novels is too broad to be assigned a single topic and is therefore classed as the "centre" of Irish novel-writing in this period. The other five clusters are the outliers of this period, and are dissimilar from the majority in the grey cluster. These include Gothic novels (<i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i> forms part of this cluster, unsurprisingly), novels concerned with Time and Place, novels explicitly about Irish issues, heavily romantic novels, and novels about Family and the Home.</p>
