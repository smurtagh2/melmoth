	<div class="text-justify">
		<p class="para">The tortuous and protracted way in which the novel was composed and published raises questions about the structure of the novel and about how much of it was intentionally crafted by Maturin. Was the novel envisaged by Maturin as it was published, as a series of stories within stories? Or had it been intended as a collection of separate tales, with one beginning as the other ended? Sharon Ragaz argues that the finished novel that was published in 1820 is perhaps better viewed as a collaboration between Maturin and his publishers and printers. Ragaz’s article, “Maturin, Archibald Constable, and the Publication of Melmoth the Wanderer”, is a detailed account of the entire saga. For Ragaz, the “text of Melmoth as we have it is the product of an extended process of collaboration, negotiation, procrastination and accident, complicated on either side by each participant’s evolving sense of professional standing, reputation and obligation at a time when the literary marketplace was rapidly changing” (372). She does not argue, however, that an analysis of the novel’s structure should be ignored in critical discussions of the text but that “such analysis must be informed by knowledge of the novel’s precarious, protracted and difficult making” (373). Most critical discussions of the novel deal with the issue of structure in some way. Jack Null argues that the disjointed and fragmented structure gives the novel a “psychological intensity” not found in novels that employ similar Gothic tropes to Melmoth (137). Other critics have interpreted the structure in terms of Irish issues, arguing that Maturin designed the structure in order to confuse and disorient readers and in order to mirror his own anxieties as a member of the minority Anglo-Irish Protestant population in Ireland threatened by increasingly politicised Catholic population who had, only two decades previously, erupted into bloody rebellion (Morin 129). Taking into account the circumstances surrounding the composition of the novel, and the fact that the structure may have been an unintended side-effect of its publication, this interpretation of the structure may be misguided. Christina Morin argues that, despite the fact that the structure of the novel may not have been intended by Maturin, the novel is nonetheless intensely preoccupied with Irish issues. For Morin, the novel is “perpetually possessed by contemporary Ireland and its troubled history” (129). Morin’s argument for Melmoth’s status as an Irish novel rests with the way that Maturin inserts Ireland into the novel “paratextually”, that is, through the novel’s footnotes (129).</p>
		<p class="para">	Two of the most obvious instances where Irish issues seep through in the novel’s footnotes occur close together in Moncada’s tale. These two instances, which Maturin ties to Irish events through his footnotes, are brought on by a scene of mob violence in the main narrative. For Luke Gibbons, this scene is evidence of Maturin’s “lethal combination of mob violence and an Irish setting” (53). Moncada, having escaped the Inquisition and now hiding in the house of a Jewish family in Madrid, witnesses a procession led by the Inquisition through the streets of Madrid. During the course of this, a man whom the crowd blames for the fire that allowed Moncada to escape, is ripped from the procession against the cries of those holy men.  This man, a parricide, who initially helped Moncada to escape from the monastery only to deceive him, is torn apart and brutally executed by the mob. The body of the man is rendered an unrecognisable lump of flesh and the late-arriving cavalry, when enquiring about the man’s whereabouts, are told he is “[b]eneath your horse’s feet”. At this point, Maturin interjects into the main narrative through an explanatory footnote where he links this fictional murder to the murder of “the unfortunate Mr. Hamilton” in Donegal in 1797. It was following this man’s violent death that a similar response was given to an officer enquiring what the heap of mud was at his horse’s feet: “The man you came for”. Gibbons points out that this man, the Rev Dr William Hamilton, was Rector and Resident Magistrate at Fanaid in Donegal. His death came as a result of his detention of some of the local leaders of the United Irishmen. He was succeeded in his role by Maturin’s brother, the Rev Hugh Maturin. Not content with a single reference to Irish events, Maturin makes another paratexual intervention linking this fictional episode of mob violence to Irish events. Monçada, upon gazing at this dreadful scene unfolding below him, is driven close to madness and it is here that Maturin, in a footnote, likens this response to the response of a shoemaker in Ireland who, during Emmet’s insurrection in Dublin 1803, witnessed the violent murder of Lord Kilwarden and was so shocked and disturbed by what he saw that he became “an idiot for life”. Julia M. Wright claims it is significant that, through his footnotes, Maturin does not tie his depiction of mob violence to similar anti-Catholic depictions in Gothic writing, such as Lewis’ The Monk, but instead ties it to real Irish events. Wright argues that Maturin’s rare footnotes “root the Gothic tale in an Irish reality”  and that Maturin recognises Ireland to be the ideal Gothic setting (166).</p>
		<p class="para">	A broader view of the text, however, shows just how little it mentions Ireland. For example, Figure 4 shows a word cloud of the most frequently used words in the novel. “Ireland’ is non-existent. Figure 5 shows that “Ireland” is directly mentioned by name fewer than  10 times in the novel. This is far less than “Spain”, mentioned almost 70 times, and “Madrid”, mentioned almost 40. It is mentioned fewer times than “England” and only slightly more often than “Europe”. This lack of direct engagement with the term “Ireland” was not unusual for Irish novelists at the time, with the notable exception of Thomas Moore. Figure 6 shows a topic model of 60 Irish novels from around 1800 to 1830. The topic of “Ireland” is an outlier and is most closely associated with Moore’s Captain Rock. Melmoth the Wanderer, also an outlier, is closely tied to the topic of “Gothic” and is far removed from “Ireland” as an explicit topic (see Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of this topic model).</p>
		<p class="para">	Despite this, many critics have read Melmoth the Wanderer as a novel about Ireland. Eagleton, for example, has argued that Melmoth’s selling of his soul can be read as an allegory of “forcible settlement and expulsion” (190). Melmoth’s transgression is contemporary with Cromwell’s conquest and this means that Melmoth’s task of “preying upon the dispossessed” can be seen as “a nightmarish image of the relations between the Ascendency and the people” (190). Christina Morin too recognises Melmoth the Wanderer as novel concerned with history and with Irish history in particular. She argues that though Melmoth the Wanderer appears on the surface not to be a novel overly concerned with Irish issues it is, in fact, haunted by Ireland and by Irish issues (131). Lew also ties Melmoth to Ireland and notes that it is a not solely historical but also a political allegory; he argues that while it is “literally about Civil War England, Spain under the Inquisition, and life on an Indian island”, it is also “about contemporary Ireland” (175).</p>
		<p class="para">	Maturin is part of a small but influential group of Protestant Anglo-Irish writers who wrote popular works of fiction in the Gothic mode, suggesting a link between the position of the Anglo-Irish population and the Gothic mode of representation. This line of authors stretches from Maturin to Sheridan LeFanu to the works of Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker. Wilde was, in fact, a great-nephew of Maturin. This Protestant Gothic is, according to Eagleton, “the political unconscious of Anglo-Irish society, the place where its fears and fantasies most definitely emerge” (187). Eagleton uses the term “political unconscious”, originally popularised by Frederic Jameson, to highlight the potential for allegory in Melmoth the Wanderer and in Gothic literature generally. For Eagleton, a political unconscious is the imaginary subtext of our real lives, “our everyday social practices and relations” (187). Within this imaginary subtext, all of our waking social interactions are warped by “their implicit violence, longing, and anxiety” and all that society has repressed is brought to light in a “monstrously distorted” way (187). This unconscious is political because it is the mirror of the collective conscious of a society, not simply of an individual. But whereas the political conscious of a society has jettisoned “all the guilt, loathing, unnameable desire” in order for it to be able to operate effectively, the political unconscious is where all of these things come to reside (188). And it is in the “collective phenomenon” of literature where this political unconscious seeps through and finds expression. Gothic literature returns this political unconscious to us in its purest and most terrifying form, revealing to us the transgressions, the exploitations, the oppression, that makes our society and our shared, collective conscious possible. And, as Eagleton writes, the turbulent political unconscious of nineteenth-century Ireland signalled a society that was “ripe for Gothic treatment” (188). For Protestant writers, in particular, the Gothic appeared as the genre most readily equipped to represent “the decaying gentry in their crumbling houses, isolated and sinisterly eccentric, haunted by the sins of the past” (188). The Gothic is the “nightmare of the besieged and reviled” (189) and the Anglo-Irish were indeed both “besieged”, in that they were surrounded by a hostile Catholic population, and “reviled”, because they had trespassed, they had transgressed, they were the usurpers. The tales in Melmoth the Wanderer bear this out. The Protestant Walbergs are besieged by the Catholic population once they move to Spain and are cheated of their inheritance. Moncada is forced into a Catholic monastery to pay for the sins of his parents and is tortured by the monks there. Indeed, Moncada cannot leave because society dictates that he cannot, he must stay to protect the honour of his family, having been born out of wedlock, while his brother enjoys the fruits of a blessed existence. Stanton is literally placed in a madhouse, again having been deceived by a family member. This madhouse contains but one person “who was not mad from politics, religion, ebriety, or some perverted passion” (Ch. 3) and, as Eagleton astutely comments, “it would not be difficult to give a national name to this gloomy asylum” (191). The paradox of the Anglo-Irish as the besieged and persecuted is that they themselves are persecutors. They are the ones in power in Ireland so why should they also be framed as the oppressed? Melmoth the Wanderer, for Eagleton, is an allegory of this strange condition where the persecutor and the persecuted hold shifting identities. The Anglo-Irish Ascendency feared the masses because the increasing likelihood of emancipation for Catholics would mean that the minority Protestant population would truly become besieged. And a mob ruled by Rome was the greatest Ascendancy fear of all.</p>
		<p class="para">	Melmoth the Wanderer’s confused, fragmented, and episodic structure could also be read as a symptom of the “crisis of representation” that affected the Irish novel in the nineteenth century. For Jacqueline Belanger, one of the most prominent features of the Irish novel in the nineteenth-century is its “perceived inability (or unwillingness) to ‘interweave’ successfully the generic requirements of the novel with the realities of religion and politics in nineteenth-century Ireland” (“Introduction” 12). Much of the work of critics in the past two decades has involved a revised approach to the study of the Irish novel in the nineteenth century, trying to rescue the Irish novel in this period from its traditional characterisation as “inferior” to the British and European novel. The nineteenth-century Irish novel’s fragmentary and episodic nature, and its perceived inadequacy in relation to the norms established by English writers, were seen as failures of the novel genre rather than as variations of the genre or as reflections of the “alternative realities” of colonial Ireland.</p>
		<p class="para">	Lloyd, in his seminal essay on violence and the Irish novel, attempts to account for this crisis in representation in the Irish novel and for the “perceived inadequacy of the Irish novel in relation to its British and European counterparts” (128). Lloyd argues not that the Irish novel was inferior to British and European novels but that the Irish novel is another mode of representation and of narrative that is connected to the representation of the history of classes of people who cannot be assimilated into dominant  historical narrative. He argues that the Irish novel suffered its crisis of representation because of the persistence of violence in Irish history. He links his argument to Antonio Gramsci’s concept of the subaltern, a term that correlates somewhat with Marx’s term “proletariat”. It has also been used to refer to groups outside of Marx’s classical definition, such as ethnic or sexual minorities, or peasant groups, in the case of Ireland. The subaltern, put simply, are social groups that lie outside of the narrative of the dominant history. Gramsci argued that there exists a hegemonic history of the ruling classes and that the historical unity of the ruling classes is achieved in the foundation of the State. The history of subaltern groups does not conform to a coherent narrative because they have not been unified in the creation of a state. This is because subaltern history is only completed and unified once the subaltern group takes over or becomes a state. There are often attempts at unification throughout subaltern history but these attempts are continually interrupted but the ruling groups. For Gramsci, the subaltern is fragmented because it is emerging. Its history will only attain narrative unity once it reaches the end of that history in the formation of the State. Lloyd, however, suggests another definition of the subaltern. He posits that if we define the subaltern not as that which “desires the state” as the united end of its history but as that which resists the state because it “cannot be represented by or in the state formation” then the episodic and fragmentary nature of subaltern history “can be read as another mode of narrative, rather than an incomplete one, of another principle of organization, rather than one yet to be unified” (127). If we remove the State as the end of history, writes Lloyd, then the subaltern becomes something else. For the State and dominant history, however, the subaltern must always be represented as violence. Lloyd argues that the subaltern, in the history of States, must be represented in this way for two reasons. Firstly, that which cannot be assimilated into the State must always be understood as disruptive and existing outside of the law. Secondly, the history of the state requires the existence of groups who can be represented as violent and barbarous so that “the history of domination and criminalization appear as a legitimate process of civilization and the triumph of law” (127). In this way, according to Lloyd, the subaltern has a “double history” (127). The have their own fragmented history and “play our their own discrete formations and traditions” but they are also part of the history of States where they are “occluded by their difference from dominant narratives and forms and by those forms themselves” (127). This, for Lloyd, means that the perceived inadequacy of the Irish novel in the early nineteenth-century can be accounted for through the violent struggle of the subaltern movements in Ireland against the dominant ruling classes. But, for Lloyd, the matter is not merely literary but is instead about representation in general. For if the Irish are repeatedly stereotyped as “violent”, as they have been by dominant history, then this obstructs their ability for self-representation. “Official history”, writes Lloyd, “cannot address the possibility that both the persistence and the forms of violence in Irish history constitute not simply barbarous aberrations but   a continuing contestation of a colonial civil society’s modes of domination and representation (128).</p>
		<p class="para">	Wright argues that the kind of narrative disruption that Lloyd is linking with the Irish novel is actually most commonly identified with the gothic genre. Wright cites a contemporary review of Melmoth the Wanderer that lambasts Maturin and his Gothic mode of writing. She suggests that the language used in this review is similar to the language applied to the “unruly Irish” (147).  The reviewer here, according to Wright, “nationalises” the Gothic and laments Maturin’s failure to adopt a more “English” mode of writing (148). Wright goes on to argue that the reviewer is criticising Maturin for the very features that allow the Anglo-Irish gothic to succeed in formalist terms, that is through “fragmented and episodic narrative structure, the staging of social crises without offering a meaningful resolution, and the evasion of ‘official history’ through narrative contestation” (147). Such features are also the ones that Lloyd associates with the Irish novel and its perceived failure. The gothic, as a literary genre, attempts to introduce, through allegorical and otherwise encoded language, truths suppressed by dominant culture and history and, Wright argues, this highlights the potential for the gothic genre to address the crisis of representation in Irish writing (148).</p>
		<p class="para">	For Eagleton, a realist novel tradition failed to establish itself in Ireland because it lacked “certain cultural preconditions” (147). The realist novel offers an image of structured and stable society, one in which individual lives are integrated as part of the whole. But, as Eagleton claims, the disrupted social conditions in Ireland precluded an image of wholeness and stability from being formed in novelistic representations that emerged from that society. Classical realism depends on the assumption that “the world is story-shaped - that there is a well-formed narrative implicit in reality itself, which it is the task of realism to represent” (Eagleton 147). Eagleton argues that Irish history is not easily read as a tale of progress and is not easily subsumed into the novel genre, which he equates with classical realism. Instead, the Irish novel in this period is “typically recursive and diffuse, launching one arbitrary narrative only to abort it for some other equally gratuitous tale, running several storylines simultaneously, ringing pedantically ingenious variations on the same few plot elements” (147). In Melmoth the Wanderer, this is exactly the view of history that Maturin is attempting to depict. History in the novel is “a subject, but not a process” (Sage, “Irish Gothic” 139).</p>
		<p class="para">	Melmoth the Wanderer is, in fact, a novel preoccupied with history, and with Irish history in particular. Nowhere is this more evident than in its title character. Melmoth the Wanderer is over 170 years old, a living piece of history. His brother was an officer in Cromwell’s New Model Army who obtained lands in Ireland following their confiscation from a Royalist Catholic family in the seventeenth century. Members of Cromwell’s New Model Army were granted lands in this way in place of their wages, which the Commonwealth of England could not afford to pay. Melmoth’s own transgression, the selling of his soul, is linked temporally to his family’s transgression, the confiscation of lands from the native Irish population. The past is never past in Melmoth the Wanderer, and the Melmoth family have a constant reminder of their own past in the cursed body of the Wanderer. Stanton, a man deceived into a mad-house and then traumatised by a visit from Melmoth, journeys to the Melmoth family home on the Wicklow coast in search of the Wanderer. When he does not find the man who tormented him, he leaves the family with a manuscript detailing Melmoth’s crime. This serves as a recorded, written history of the Wanderer’s transgression and a reminder of the Melmoth family’s implication in historical crimes. Monçada, another character tormented by Melmoth, is shipwrecked in front of the Melmoth house, another soul come to remind the Wanderer’s family about their past transgressions. Melmoth’s interactions with the people of Europe, Stanton being an Englishman and Monçada being a Spaniard, mean that knowledge of the Melmoth’s transgressions are not confined within Irish borders and have become known on the continent.  Laura Doyle has argued that Melmoth’s “wandering” of the globe, and the carrying of stories from one locale to the other, is part of the Gothic genre’s contribution to an “anxious global consciousness” (516).</p>
		<p class="para">	A portrait of the Wanderer is also one of the Melmoth family’s unwanted heirlooms. This portrait is dated 1646, prior to establishment of the Melmoths as a landed family in Ireland. This date, while not overtly or specifically significant, was a particularly turbulent time in the history of Ireland and Britain. 1646 places the creation of Melmoth’s painted image in the middle of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Melmoth, by his presence alone, pulls everyone back to a time of bloodshed and war. History can never be interpreted, can never be overcome, when it is still being lived. In Ireland in the early nineteenth century, history pervaded the present moment. In Maturin's time, it was the memory of the 1798 rebellion in particular, as well as the subsequent political union of Ireland and Britain,  that continued to be contested. </p>
		<p class="para">	“The 1798 rebellion” writes Kevin Whelan in his book, The Tree of Liberty, “was fought twice: once on the battlefields and then in the war of words which followed in those bloody footprints” (133). The 1798 rebellion dominated much of the political debate surrounding the Act of Union and its aftermath. It “never passed into history, because it never passed out of politics” (Whelan 133). The ability to construct a shared past and to mould a collective memory was a powerful political tool. Whelan notes that the political attempts to construct a narrative of the past in which the significance and the meaning of 1798 could be elaborated “were deeply implicated in the existing political divisions” (133). Jim Kelly argues that it is this kind of conflict, one between history and memory, that is at the heart of Melmoth the Wanderer. Melmoth is the only character in the novel that “has any access to an accurate history, or at least one that can be characterised as delivered with “a minute fidelity” (171). Melmoth’s unnaturally long life allows him to offer authentic eye-witness accounts of events and occurrences that fall well beyond the bounds of the standard human memory and, for Kelly, this situates the character of the Wanderer as “a cipher for unresolved historical conflict” (150). The character of Melmoth the Wanderer is an allegorical representation of the strained relationship between eye-witness accounts and historiography. He is both the speaker and the subject of history, both the “representative and the representation” (Kelly 150). Kelly argues that Maturin was preoccupied with the relationship between history and memory; he is constantly returning to “the difference between a lived historical memory and more ‘objective’ forms of historical inquiry” throughout the novel (Kelly 169). Similarly, Baldick states the novel is “secretly as much about transmission as it is about transgression” (xii). In this way, Baldick points to a paradox that disallows Melmoth from passing on his curse but that forces other characters to absorb the knowledge of that burden and to pass it on through written or oral testimony. In nineteenth-century Ireland, memories of past wrongs committed survived by their transmission through subsequent generations. In 1808 a man named Thomas Halpin, while carrying out undercover work in the Limerick area, experienced this first hand when he was told by someone of an act committed in 1690 that would yet be revenged (Bartlett 319). Halpin wrote that the people seem to know the “minutest circumstances” of an event a hundred years ago “as well as if it was a transaction of a late date” (qtd. in Bartlett 319).</p>
		<p class="para">	Eagleton sees time and history in the novel as suspended. He argues that Melmoth has been frozen in an “eternal present” and ties this to Oliver McDonagh’s characterisation of the Irish view of history in which “a wrong, once perpetrated can never be undone by chronological succession but is doomed ceaselessly to re-enact itself” (190.) Joep Leerson too sees MacDonagh’s characterisation as significant. For Leerson, in nineteenth-century Ireland, “bygones are anything but bygones, and the past continues to carry an immediate ideological relevance for current attitudes and current affairs” (9). In nineteenth-century Ireland, and in Melmoth the Wanderer in particular, history can never be interpreted because it never concludes. Conciliation is obstructed because sins can never be atoned for, wrongs never righted, crimes never punished, and transgressions never forgiven. As Victor Sage puts it, history in Melmoth the Wanderer “is a subject, but not a process” (“Irish Gothic” 139). Instead of a broad an encompassing history, Maturin is holding a “broken mirror” up to that history (Sage, “Irish Gothic” 139). He is not interested in showing the process of history nor is he interested in describing some sort of coherent historical narrative. As Sage argues, Maturin is “interested in allegory, structural repetition, variation, refraction, and romance plots of disguise and revelation rather than the assimilation of point of view to a grand sweep of historical narrative” (“Irish Gothic” 139). There can be no lessons learned from history because it is always present in the character of Melmoth the Wanderer who has obtained, through his transgression, mastery of space and of time. He tells Stanton that he is “independent of time and place” and his ancestor, the young John Melmoth, describes him as “extraordinary being, whose charmed life, ‘def[ies] space and time’”. The character of Melmoth was even present during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, his brother having gained the lands of a Royalist Catholic family. This, says Sage, is historical narrative “turned inside out” (“Irish Gothic” 140).</p>
		<p class="para">	One of the reasons that the memory of 1798 was so contested was because of its intensely sectarian nature. Stories of religiously-motivated attacks and massacres were common on both sides of the conflict. The rebellion had a religious character that was evident even in the months leading up to the wider outbreak in the summer of 1798 (Bartlett 232). Stories of Catholic cruelty were widespread. Sections of the Protestant population were relishing the outbreak of insurrection and anti-Catholic sentiment was spreading. In March 1798, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Camden, declared that <blockquote>Eager Protestants [are] calling the present conspiracy a Popish plot, are indulging in the language and conduct revolting to the Catholics, are encouraging the Orange men, avowing themselves of their society, and [are] averring that until the Penal laws against the Catholics are again enacted the country cannot be safe (qtd. in Bartlett 232)</blockquote>A young Daniel O’Connell recognised the increased hostility and remarked that “the odium against Catholics is becoming every day more inveterate” (qtd. in Bartlett 232). Camden, upon the outbreak of open rebellion, observed that “party and religious prejudice has literally made the Protestant part of the country mad” (qtd. in Bartlett 232). Stories of massacres and atrocities abounded both during and after the rebellion. The rebellion was framed as “a ‘Popish Plot’, a religious war, or even a return of the 1641 rebellion” (Bartlett 235). The rebellion was quelled in September despite the arrival of 1100 French troops in early August (Bartlett 234). The very fact that French troops had touched down in Ireland terrified the administrations in Dublin and London and for many it was further evidence of Catholic disloyalty. According to Bartlett, the rebellion had “shattered relationships within Ireland” and had evoked fears and awakened memories of 1641 (Bartlett 234). The rebellion had also called into question to very future of the Irish political and constitutional settlement.</p>
		<p class="para">	The political response to 1798 was the Act of Union. This too was divisive. Its goal was to settle the Irish question once and for all, through the assimilation of Ireland into the political unit of the United Kingdom. The Acts of Union themselves were a pair of complementary acts passed by both the British and the Irish parliaments in 1800. The acts came into force on 1 January 1801. The text of these acts stated that “in order to promote and secure the essential interests of Great Britain and Ireland, and to consolidate the strength, power and resources of the British Empire, it will be advisable to concur in such measures as may best tend to unite the two kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland into one kingdom” (“Union with Ireland Act 1800”). Initially, it was believed that the Union would contain concessions to Catholics.  As Bartlett states, it was a widely-held political position that “Catholic disloyalty” could only be tackled through a legislative union with Great Britain (Bartlett 228). Any potential union was, for a time, regarded as a precursor to Catholic Emancipation.  However, the union that was eventually carried by the British and Irish parliaments was a “purely Protestant” one that “would prove a fatal bar to the final resolution of the Catholic question” (Bartlett 228). Catholics in Ireland, instead of being subsumed into United Kingdom as equal citizens, found themselves fighting the same fight as they had prior to the union. The acts created a single parliament, which would sit in London, and to which both the enfranchised people of both Ireland and Great Britain would elect members. Catholics, however, could not sit in that parliament. In failing to address the status of Catholics, the Act of Union ensured that the Catholic question, and the Irish question, would remain open.</p>
		<p class="para">	In 1818, at the time Maturin began composing Melmoth the Wanderer, Ireland was in a period of relative inactivity with regard to the Catholic question. The Catholic movement had suffered as a result of division and infighting in the preceding years. The mass politics of O’Connell was still years away; Catholic Emancipation itself was more than a decade away and would not come to pass until 1829. But the question itself had not been resolved.. For example, in 1818, the year Maturin began writing Melmoth, Charles Grant was appointed to the post of Chief Secretary in Ireland. Grant was a known supporter of Catholic Emancipation and, even though this had little to do with his selection, it signalled “that the catholic question was to be considered an open one” (Connolly 66). Also, by 1818, a large majority of Irish M.P.s were in favour of Emancipation, and an “identifiable and often crucial Catholic interest was evident in most constituencies” (Bartlett 297).</p>
		<p class="para">	Maturin was not a politician and there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in politics. He had supposedly been courted for patronage by Dublin Castle at one point who ? the castle? sent an official out to his home to put the offer to him, but Maturin made a poor impression on the man and the idea was abandoned (“Memoranda” 128). Maturin was, according to an 1892 memoir, opposed to the Union and was keenly aware of the struggles of his home country (“Memoir”). In a letter to Scott, Maturin bemoans his fragile financial situation but recognises that national issues are of more importance than his own: “[W]hile the Country is struggling for Existence,” he writes, “she has little leisure to attend to private complaints – in the Battle for life and death we are now fighting, the Cries of the wounded can neither be heard or pitied” (Ratchford and McCarthy 9). Dale Kramer claims Maturin was a “fervent nationalist and opponent of the Act of Union” with a “fondness for Irish tradition and affection for the miserable Irish masses” (12). In the preface to his first novel, Fatal Revenge; or the Family of Montorio, Maturin, while hiding his identity proudly declares his nationality: “let this serve to inform my Readers, that I am four and twenty, that I never had literary friend or counsellor, and that I am an Irishman of the name of Dennis Jasper Murphy” (emphasis in original) (Fatal Revenge viii). His adopted pseudonym did indeed have a very Irish ring to it; Maturin later agreed with a visitor to his home who suggested that  his pseudonym’s “vulgar and merely Irish sound” injured the sales of his early novels (“Maturin” 248).</p>
		<p class="para">	On 15 July 1801, around the time of his graduation from Trinity College, he wrote a letter to William Conygham Plunket, a champion of the cause of Catholic Emancipation. In this letter he  expresses his admiration for the man and his support for the cause of emancipation. Two decades later, in 1824, the year of his death, he delivered and published his Five Sermons on Errors of the Roman Catholic Church.  In these sermons, Maturin rallies against a wide variety of what he perceives to be flaws in the Catholic belief system and in the institution of the Church. He questions the very foundation of the Catholic Church in the figure of St. Peter and takes issue with numerous Catholic sacraments, while coming out against the concept of tradition as a basis for truth. He occasionally wanders into the political realm, however. In his first sermon, for example, he asks: “And is this, then, a time to be silent? - and if it were, is this a country to be silent in ?”, the implication being that the Catholic question in Ireland remained an open one (18). While the majority of his audience are obviously members of the Church of Ireland, he does acknowledge that his sermons have attracted a number of Catholics into his audience: “I entreat, therefore, my Roman Catholic brethren, as I perceive many of them are present…” (29). Maturin’s language is quite moderate, he saves his rancour for institutions and specific expressions of faith. At the outset of his second sermon he declares “in the strongest language, that I am about to direct my present address, not against Catholics, but against Catholicism - not against individuals, but against abstract opinions” (27). He claims that of all the Protestant ministers in Dublin he has had the most dealings with Catholics and has found many of them to be “truly amiable and excellent” (27). He tells his congregation that in such company he has often held his tongue on what he perceives as errors in the Roman Catholic faith and, apparently, errors in the pursuit of Catholic Emancipation. For Maturin, the “true Catholic Emancipation” is “the emancipation of the intellect and the conscience”. That is, emancipation from the Catholic religion itself. Maturin, while remaining moderate for most of these sermons, becomes confrontational in his fourth sermon, most notably when responding to a book of sermons published in 1822 by a Catholic priest, Rev. Mr Hayes. Maturin cites a number of lines from this book which he claims are confrontational and designed to antagonise Protestants. Maturin then uses this language as a stick to beat the entire cause of Catholic emancipation by strangely asking that if this is the kind of language that Catholics use when they are “in a state of oppression, privation, and persecution” then what kind of language would they use “if they obtained all they demand” (97). Maturin stops himself here and tells his audience that he does not interfere with politics and he “resign[s] the question to deeper heads than mine” (97).  But he cannot resist and ends his fourth sermon with a rallying cry to Irish Catholics. “Roman Catholics of Ireland hear me!” he bellows from the pulpit,<blockquote><p class="para">Ye call on the rulers of the land for emancipation - emancipate yourselves from the yoke that has pressed on your intellects and your consciences for centuries, - a yoke that neither you nor your fathers were able to bear - a yoke that centuries ago has been shaken off by countries less civilized, as well as by the most civilized countries in Europe, England, and Scotland. Whatever be the civil restraints ye complain of, I do not judge; but remember this, that the restraints ye voluntarily bear are a thousand times more deadly than any earthly despot could possibly lay on man. The shackles of political restraint when once broken, leave no marks; but the iron of priestcraft “entirety into the soul.” You are a high-feeling, a high-fated people. Wherefore are ye not a happy, and a free one? - because ye do not dare to think. For centuries you have been deluded, benighted, and misled; and while Europe involuntarily eulogized your genius and valour, Europe has wept for your blindness, bigotry, and infatuation.</p><p class="para">	Would you be free? Enfranchise yourselves. Say to your  priests, we reverence your function - we respect your persons - but we will think for ourselves. We will read the Scriptures, to know what the religion of Christ is; we will read history, to know what the Roman Catholic religion has been; will compare; we will judge; we will decide for ourselves. Say this respectfully; but do it resolutely - do it perseveringly - and unborn ages will bless the event. In your struggles for what you call political freedom, remember that spiritual freedom is far above it, and that freedom every man can bestow on himself. (123-4)</p></blockquote>In his fifth and final sermon on the errors of the Roman Catholic Church, Maturin claims that thus far his language has been moderate. But if Roman Catholics do not respond in equal tones of moderation, says Maturin, he will “unclose those stores of horror and of absurdity of which History keeps key” and will “lay bare the foul and festering corruption to the loathing eye of day” (131-132). But Maturin had already done so, he had already turned the key on some on the “horrors” of the Roman Catholic church and he did it through his fiction, through his novel Melmoth the Wanderer. For Maturin, the Inquisition was the “most direful instrument of popery” (118). He says that “every Irish heart, no matter whether it beats in a Roman Catholic, or a Protestant breast” should “triumph” at the fact the Inquisition never reached Ireland (118). Through the interlocking stories of Melmoth the Wanderer, Maturin describes the horror of that institution and his fears of the Catholic Church as the dominant force in Irish society.</p>
		<p class="para">	In these sermons, and in Melmoth the Wanderer, we read Maturin’s fear of an Irish national identity that was increasingly being defined in Catholic terms. Maturin was a nationalist, a unionist, and perhaps even proud to be Irish. He was a leader in his community, albeit an outsider in his own Church. But, even so, he had a stake in Ireland’s future. His fear was not of the people of Ireland but of Rome. This is why he points to the European mainland so often in Melmoth the Wanderer. He is showing a vision of an Irish future that he believe has a real danger of coming to pass. In his final sermon, we witness Maturin’s fear, not of Irish Catholicism as it was then, but of the Irish Catholicism that could come to be under the increased influence of European Catholicism:<blockquote> It is not from this country that we are to take our estimate of the Roman Catholick Church - here, under the eye of a more enlightened community, her laity are reserved and circumspect, and her priests cannot, as in other countries - play such fantastic tricks before high heaven, as might make angels weep. Look to where she has established her head quarters - look to Spain - to Portugal - to Italy - what a picture do they present? A Clergy without learning - a nobility without education - a commonality without occupation - a population without subsistence - a mass of mendicants without number - and a country without a national character, save that of indolence, beggary, sensuality, and superstition - a country that unites the widest extremes of mental and moral degradation, and combines all the refinements of vice, with the simplicity of the profoundest ignorance — where the libertine rushes reeking from the brothel to the confessional, and the shrine gives alternate shelter to the penitent and the assassin - a country, where the native, the born vassal of the deadliest of despots - priestly power - dare not even call his soul his own—where he lives without one generous purpose - one lofty thought, one glorious aspiration after mental distinction or moral utility - nay, even one improvement in science, or one effort of imagination; for the latter would consign his book to the Index Expurgatorius; and the former, his person to the prison of the Inquisition - in a word, where those who slumber on the surface of the ground, scarce differ from those who slumber below it, and the tenant of the soil is like the tenant of the grave. Such is the picture of Italy, the head quarters of the Roman Catholic religion—such are the effects of that religion, where it is permitted to reign unbounded and uncontrolled. (154-155)</blockquote></p>
		<p class="para">Maturin’s critique of Catholicism could never have occurred in a novel set primarily in Ireland because it was not Irish Catholics that he feared but an Catholic Irish nation under the influence of Rome. Others have argued, however, that Melmoth the Wanderer is an example of “imperial Gothic” where Maturin’s apparent attack on the Catholic Church is actually an attack on empire in general and on British rule in Ireland. Massimiliano Demata, for example, argues that through Melmoth the Wanderer we can read Maturin’s “anxiety over the colonial enterprise” (27). Moncada is conquered and oppressed by the Catholic Church, which itself was an empire and “an instrument of colonization which converted the colonized” (29). Demata argues that Maturin could not offer a sustained and explicit critique of British rule in Ireland because of his precarious position in the Church of Ireland but that, in the “Tale of the Spaniard”, he is implicitly critiquing that rule. For Demata, Maturin believed in an Irish identity separate from Britain which had been threatened by the Act of Union. The Union, for Maturin, was not one of equals and Demata believes that Maturin resented British hegemony for its eclipsing of Irish identity.</p>
		<p class="para">	A broader view of the novel not tied specifically to Irish issues leads to an interpretation of the novel in which the individual is pitted against systems of power. There are two accounts of Melmoth the Wanderer’s status as a Gothic novel, on grounds not connected to its Irish provenance.. Baldick argues that both of these accounts are potentially misleading. The first account places the novel as the last, and greatest, Gothic novel “in the line from Walpole through Radcliffe and Lewis” (ix). The problem with this account, according to Baldick, is that the Gothic mode of writing continued to trundle on well after Melmoth, being most notably revived in the work of Poe. Gothic writing did not end with Maturin and it has continuously haunted Western literature. The alternative account hails Maturin as independent from the Radcliffe line and as an antecedent of Dostoevsky and Kafka. Within this account, Maturin is “a psychological novelist rather than a reteller of ghoulish gimmicks” (ix). Baldick does not see these two traditions, between which Melmoth so often floats, as incompatible. Melmoth is both a psychological novel and one that contains the standard trappings of Gothic fare and Baldick points to David Punter’s survey of Gothic writing, The Literature of Terror, which offers a more helpful delineation of the varieties of Gothic fiction and which allows us to reconcile the “contending versions of Melmoth’s Gothic status” (ix). In Punter’s survey, he points out that “although Gothic fiction may be most easily recognised by its paraphernalia of props and settings, its distinctive animating principle is a psychological interest in states of trepidation, dread, panic, revulsion, claustrophobia, and paranoia” (Baldick, ix). Baldick argues that such a description leads to the recognition of “another cycle of novels” that are not “full-dress Gothic” but that do share some important features with traditional and celebrated Gothic works. This other cycle, according to Baldick, includes Melmoth the Wanderer, Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein (1818), Caleb Williams (1794) and St Leon (1799) by Shelly’s father, William Godwin, and Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824) by James Hogg. This group of novels, says Baldick, is not as full-on Gothic as Radcliffean fictions and “tend to rely less on the evocation of atmosphere from a monastic or castellar setting than on a fabulous principle of transgression, usually involving the Faustian acquisition of forbidden knowledge” (x).</p>
		<p class="para">	Generating a two-dimensional topic model from a corpus of these novels does bear this theory out to some extent, with a clear distinction between Radcliffe’s novels and these other novels. Of course, we should expect a two-dimensional topic model of a small corpus of novels, nearly half of which are Radcliffe novels, to separate itself in this way, between Radcliffe novels and non-Radcliffe novels. What is interesting about this model, however, is that Melmoth the Wanderer, The Monk, Frankenstein, and The Castle of Otranto all fall between the two topics, with a slight pull towards the psychological, highlighting the fact that they all contain significant Radcliffean elements. Figure 7 shows a visualisation of the model.</p>
		<p class="para">It is with this “Godwinian” or psychological group of Gothic novels that Melmoth is most strongly associated. Baldick argues that this may go some of the way to explaining the novel’s structure. Whereas Radcliffe’s romances are narrated by a “pious and rational” omniscience, the narratives of these “Godwinian novels” tend to favour first-person testimony which lead us “back through ‘flashback’ recollections and embedded tales-within-tales to a realm of inward disturbance not commonly accessible to the more placid conventions of third-person narration” (x). Baldick notices a trend here and postulates that the myth of transgression requires a particular narrative strategy where the actual horror of the story comes to us through second-hand report and testimony. While Melmoth’s narrative structure remains “freakishly irregular” by the standards of other prominent Gothic novels in this style, it still can be subsumed under this “law of Gothic design” (x).</p>
		<p class="para">	It is from Godwin that Maturin inherits the trend of individualism present in Melmoth the Wanderer. Individualism champions the individual over the institution and places an emphasis on the importance of self-reliance and the danger of the influence of external human systems. Maggie Kilgour defines Godwin’s work as the antithesis of Edmund Burke’s who, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, set out to defend the “old systems of gothic tyranny” (Kilgour 47). Godwin believed such systems encouraged superstition in the masses, which the ruling classes then exploited in order to oppress. He was an ardent proponent of individualism and condemned all external systems as oppressors of a person’s independence and of their unique identity. Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice is a response to Burke’s Reflections and, according to Kilgour, it positions Godwin as a descendent of seventeenth-century radical thought. Godwin’s ideology of individualism was a political one and he believed that government institutions were an evil influence that denied individual identity. </p>
		<p class="para">	Maturin’s own brand of individualism in Melmoth the Wanderer manifests itself in an attack on the Roman Catholic church and other organised religions. Most likely as a result of his Calvinist upbringing, Maturin was highly critical of religious institutions that would seek to step in as intermediaries between the individual and God. Maturin’s great fear was an increased influence of Catholicism in Ireland, which at the time was less than a decade away from Catholic emancipation. In Melmoth the Wanderer, Maturin’s criticisms of Catholicism are established as attacks on the system and not on the individual. He is highly critical of institutions such as monasteries and the Inquisition but less critical of Catholic priests, such as Fra Jose in the “Tale of the Indians” and the good priest in the “Tale of Guzman’s Family”. Maturin is similar to Godwin in that they were both heavily influenced by a Calvinist upbringing and both were influenced by the works of Rousseau, which, in Maturin’s case, can most notably be seen in the story of Immalee/Isidora in Melmoth the Wanderer.</p>
		<p class="para">Maturin, through Melmoth the Wanderer, attempts to depict an Ireland that has been denied progress. Irish history, in Maturin’s time, was disputed. Religion too, in Maturin’s estimation, held Ireland back. In his sermons we can see how the possibility of an Irish nation, however much he would have liked to have seen one, frightened him with the likelihood that it would be a Catholic nation, ruled by Rome, where the mob ruled and individual liberty was threatened. In the end, there is no resolution to Melmoth the Wanderer. The novel, like Irish history at the time, could not conclude. Instead, it launches story after story without resolution until the end of the final volume when the stories begin to collapse in frustration, still never fully resolving themselves, but instead pointing to a potential resolution in the frame narrative which itself is snatched away in its very final moments. Maturin had more to say about his Wanderer but he never had the chance. He was forced by his publisher, not unfairly given the circumstances, to finish his story so that it would neatly fill four volumes. The sequel suggested by Maturin would not be entertained by his publisher at all. The story of the Wanderer was to remain unresolved. It is the Irish story in Melmoth the Wanderer that is at the root of the overall failure of resolution in the novel. All the other tales, the British tales of Stanton and of Elinor, the Spanish tales of Moncada and the Walbergs, the Indian tale of Immalee, depend on the frame narrative, the Irish tale, for resolution. It is in this story that the Wanderer reaches the end of his 150 years of life but we never see his end. Instead, Moncada and the young John Melmoth are left speechless and simply return to the Melmoth house, unsure of what they have just witnessed. Do the characters of the other tales receive justice in the downfall of the one who tormented them or has Melmoth bargained his way to another extension on his life? They, nor we, will ever know.</p>
