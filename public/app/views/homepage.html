			<div class="col-xs-10 home_bio_content">Melmoth the Wanderer is a novel about an Irishman from the seventeenth-century who sells his soul  to the devil. In return he is endowed with forbidden knowledge, an unnaturally long life, and the ability to appear anywhere on Earth. At the end of 150 years of life, however, Melmoth will be consigned to hell. But there is a way out: Melmoth will be spared this hellish fate if, within that 150 years, he can find just a single person willing to give up their soul to him. The novel is structured as multiple stories within stories, like a Russian nesting doll, with each tale depicting a character who is tempted by Melmoth’s offer. It is often cited as the last of the first-wave gothic novels and sometimes as the greatest gothic novel of them all. It was written by an eccentric Anglo-Irish Protestant cleric named Charles R. Maturin, who began composing the novel in 1818. It was eventually published  in 1820. <a href="paratexts">Learn More about the novel...</a></div>

			<div class="col-xs-10 home_bio_content">Maturin was born in Dublin in the year 1780. As an author he was active from 1807 until his death in 1824. This positioned him between two important dates in Irish history: the 1800 Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland and the 1829 Roman Catholic Relief Act. Maturin never lived to see the culmination of the process of Catholic Emancipation, he died in 1824, but the Catholic question was the prevailing political topic of his day, especially in relation to Ireland. Maturin was a Protestant cleric in the wealthy parish of St. Peter’s in Dublin but he lived on the verge of poverty for most of his adult life. He was nonetheless a representative of a minority Church in Ireland whose members were the ruling class. Perhaps due to Maturin’s position as a Protestant cleric, Melmoth the Wanderer has been read by some as a manifestation of Protestant terror in the face of an increasingly politicised Catholic population in Ireland. <a href="paratexts">Learn More about Maturin...</a></div>

		<tab heading="What is this edition?">
			<div class="home_bio_content">This edition is designed as a "multi-view" edition. It offers a number of different ways of reading the text: by chapter, by tale, by search term, and by theme. This edition is also designed as a meeting point between quantitative and qualitative analyses of literature. This was achieved topic modelling a corpus of texts contemporary to the novel and by making the results of those models available while browsing the edition text and while reading the paratexts.</div>
