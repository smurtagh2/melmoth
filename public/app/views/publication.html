	<h1>Publication of <i>Melmoth the Wanderer</i></h1>

		<p class="para">On May 2 1818 Maturin wrote to his Constable to inform him of his next work. This work was to be a poem of distinct parts, similar to Moore's Lalla Rookh. These separate parts would all be connected by a prose narrative. Constable was enthusiastic about the project and advised Maturin to proceed. Over two and a half years later, in October 1820, the novel finally went to print.</p>
		<p class="para">	This delay was, for the most part, caused by Maturin. When he first suggested the novel, Maturin was already engaged on another project with Constable: the publication of a collection of sermons delivered by Maturin at St. Peter's in Dublin. Unfortunately, Maturin did not have enough sermons to fill a volume and so he was forced to compose new sermons causing the first of many delays to the composition of “Tales”, the working title for Melmoth the Wanderer  (8 Mar 1819). Once the sermons had been completed and were ready for publication, Constable urged Maturin to give his full attention to the composition of his “Tales” (21 Apr 1819). Maturin, at this point, was yet to send over any manuscript pertaining to the “Tales”, despite it being nearly a year since he had been engaged by Constable on the project. On 26 April 1819 Maturin promised to send over part of the manuscript of the “Tales” but the project has apparently evolved since he first mentioned it in May of 1818. While in that letter Maturin had suggested a poem comprised of distinct parts connected through a prose narrative, it now appeared that the poems were only “incidental” to the narrative and were now merely “supposed productions of one of the characters” (26 Apr 1819). Maturin advised that the poetic parts must now “appear in the body of the work” (26 Apr 1819). Constable was not dismayed by this and agreed with Maturin that the poetry should be introduced just as it appeared in the body of the text (30 Apr 1819). Maturin angered Constable, however, when he told him that the composition of “Tales” would be delayed because he was to concentrate on writing a new play. Constable advised against this and implored him to continue with the novel. Maturin agreed on the condition that Constable would forward him an advance on his pay, having now lost out from the postponement of his new play (11 May 1819). Constable promised an advance on receipt of half of the manuscript of “Tales”. </p>
		<p class="para">	On 23 July 1819, the first part of the manuscript of “Tales” was finally with Constable. On 4 August 1819, Constable received a second portion of manuscript and was confused because it seemed to be “the commencement of the third volume, and also of the second Tale”. Maturin had failed to send the rest of the first Tale. Constable also complained that there was still no title attached to the first tale nor to the novel overall. On 11 August 1819, Constable wrote to say that the printer cannot proceed because they were “still without the continuation of the M.S. of Vol 1”. On 2 September 1819, Constable wrote again in confusion about the further manuscript he had just received. He wrote that only a small portion of the new manuscript was a continuation of the first tale and that “we cannot go on with the second till we have the first done”. He also told Maturin that, because of the lack of a title from Maturin, they had named the first tale ‘Melmoth’. At this point, Maturin is either sending manuscript off as he writes it, with no clear idea of how all of the tales fit together, or the elaborate structure and his failure to explain it clearly is causing confusion for Constable and the printer. Constable asked Maturin to “be as explicit as you can on describing the M.S. you send us” (2 Sept 1819). A week later, on the receipt of more manuscript, a considerable amount, but without any guidance of how it all fits together, Constable reaches breaking point with Maturin:<blockquote>We have just received another Packet of M.S. through the Post Office, and we do now write to you with feelings of considerable chagrin to express our deep distress and concern at the careless way the MS has hitherto come to hand, so much so, as to put an entire stop to all our plans and proceedings. We received by our Clerk a considerable quantity, but strange today it was so unconnected, that with great difficulty we find part of it belonging to the first Tale, and a part to the second, at least we thought so, so little however appeared to connect with the first Tale that we could not make up the third sheet and what is just recd. is in no way so far as we can notice, connected with what is received of the first—in one words we are wholly at a stand, and it is utterly impossible that the Work can proceed except some plan is pursued whereby the connection of the various portions of the MS is kept up—there is no paging, no connecting word nothing to guide us—and after corresponding for two months there are only two sheets set up and that without a title—you have never yet said what portion was lost or how it fitted with what came before. We write to you our feelings thus plainly and explicitly, and assure you if this continues we will be under the necessity of throwing up the undertaking, and begging repayment of our Advances. In your letter you clear up in no way the many queries we have put to you, as to the lost M.S. &c but what is truly is most agonizing is that all our letters produce no change. The MS comes en masse and we are utterly at a loss how to proceed with it.  (9 Sept 1819)</blockquote></p> 
		<p class="para">Maturin from now on appeared to be more reliable with dispatching manuscript, probably as a result of Constable’s threat to cancel the project and to request repayment of the advance paid. The relationship between Maturin and his publisher appeared to have been rescued to some extent. Even so, when Maturin wrote to Constable in November 1819 to tell him of his plans to create a second set of tales and extend the work to 8 volumes, Constable was naturally hesitant. He wrote that had no objection to this as long as the first set of tales remained an independent venture that did not rely on the second set of tales for its conclusion. However, Constable was careful to point out, in a letter on 22 November 1819, that as things stood he would prefer to only be engaged as publisher on the first set of tales. </p>
		<p class="para">Maturin at this point seemed to have a clearer picture of the structure of the book and was able to tell Constable where each volume should begin and end (21 Jan 1820). Constable was still unaware of the overall plan, however, and asked Maturin what his plans are “regarding the book altogether” and to “let us know fully what you intend” (21 Jan 1820). The relationship was tested once more when Maturin suggested extending the novel from four volumes to five volumes. Constable wrote on the 11 February 1820 “to state most explicitly, that the book will not do in any way in five Volumes”. A five-volume work, according to Constable, simply will not sell. Maturin continued to ask Constable to agree to a second set of tales but Constable would not hear of it, his relationship with Maturin had clearly been soured by Maturin’s unprofessional approach to the publication of Melmoth. On 19 February 1820, Constable wrote that he “would rather defer making any proposal for the continuation of the Tales”. On 15 Apr 1820 he wrote to say he was “very sorry that it has not been suitable to the views of my house to enter into a new engagement as to a further collection or Continuation of your tales”. And on 27 April 1820, he wrote mentioning an offer from Colburn, another publisher, to print the next four volumes of tales and asked Maturin not to engage in “farther correspondence on the subject with my house”. Another obstacle emerged as Maturin continued to send manuscript for the fourth volume which had already exceeded the agreed length of the volume and the novel. On 10 July 1820, Constable wrote to say that the fourth volume is already too large and that “we do not notice any thing near a finish”. He repeated his assertion that “the book will be utterly ruined in 5 vols”. On 27 September 1820 it appeared that the novel was finished, in four volumes, and proofs had been sent to Maturin. It was at this point that Maturin finally suggested the title: Melmoth the Wanderer. </p>
